Linux (QuebesOS preferred; don't argue with me), Security and Network Engineer.  

Some *key* personal opinions you may find shaping my works:

1/ If you don't compile from `dom0` then you're not [living life to the full](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/how-to-install-software-in-dom0/). DNF is the best, you cannot -- and will not -- change my mind. 

2/ The older I get, the more I start to appreciate this interface view: 
```
!
interface FastEthernet0/14
 switchport access vlan 197
 switchport voice vlan  198
 switchport priority extend cos 1
 srr-queue bandwidth share 1 30 35 5
 priority-queue out
 mls qos trust cos
 auto qos trust
 spanning-tree portfast
!
```
3/ Of couse, there are more important things in a functional network, such as how many LACP instances you've got enabled. But enough of that. I am versatile in *Cisco*, *Aruba*, *Ubiquiti*, *Juniper* and their supporting products. Always looking for an excuse to make LACP in your network.
