- 👋 Hi, I’m [@DankyNanky](https://blink.by/DAnkyNanky).

I mostly just am called 'Nank' by friends and family, but my name is Michael. Nank was a shortened nickname for my last name, and has just since stuck. 

- 👀 I’m interested in Scripting, Automation and Networking

I use Powershell way too much, and am very interested in expanding beyond my Aruba courses, CCNA, and furthering my current networking and systems understanding. I am very new to AWS, Azure, GCP and other cloud-focused services; Docker, Cubes and other virtualisation services are next on the agenda. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Powershell, .NET and Python

It's a very slow process. It takes time, patience and dedication; all of which are hard to commit to! Currently using Udemy and generic repositories for learning, with no real structure. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AWS deployment and Azure AD Development. 

Security Profioling, User Administration and Reporting, Software Enforcement (Endpoint Manager) and System/Service Stacks are what I am focused on; uplifting aged technologies and keeping relevant!

- 📫 How to reach me on a few social medias. You can just look at my [page](https://blink.by/DAnkyNanky).
