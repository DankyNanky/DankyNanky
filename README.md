If you want, you can view alot of my old work(s) here. This site is used as a Q&A, and is where I like to linger.

### Networking
The older I get, the more I start to appreciate this interface view: 
```
!
interface FastEthernet0/14
 switchport access vlan 197
 switchport voice vlan  198
 switchport priority extend cos 1
 srr-queue bandwidth share 1 30 35 5
 priority-queue out
 mls qos trust cos
 auto qos trust
 spanning-tree portfast
!
```
Of couse, there are more important things in a functional network, such as how many LACP instances you've got enabled. But enough of that. I am versatile in *Cisco*, *Aruba*, *Ubiquiti*, *Juniper* and their supporting products. Always looking for an excuse to make LACP in your network.

### Social Media
I try not to have too much social media -- and the media I do have, I try to decouple from my 'professional' work. There is no company branded social media at this point in time. 

If you want to game, [check out my highly inappropriate profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/DankyNanky/) ;) 

I *presently* do not have Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat, Twitter, Discord, TeamSpeak, and any other social media account that you might ask. I do stalk [Superuser](https://stackexchange.com/users/3557691/dankynanky) and Reddit, though.
